# Preno

Create a new account or use the following data:
login: admin@admin.pl
password: qwaszx

## Preno is a six-step reservation system:
1. Choose a service.
2. Choose a worker that provides the service (sometimes there's one worker to choose, sometimes there are all of them).
3. Choose a day (but some days are days off - different days for different workers).
4. Choose a free hour: if your worker is busy, time slots are red; if duration of your service makes reservation impossible - time slots are orange.
5. Enter your data.
6. Check your reservation and book your reservation.

## Admin features
- lists of all workers, reservations and services
- details of every worker, reservaion, service
- delete a worker, service or a reservation
- add a worker or a service and bind them to each other
